    README.txt: This file.
    SetTestWeights_C*.RNA.and.protein.txt: File containing the weights for 37 tissues from version 16 of the
        Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org; Uhl√©n M et al, DOI: 10.1126/science.1260419) for all gene sets in one of the Molecular Signatures Database version 6.0 collections.
        The file contains tab-separated weights generated according to the procedure outlined in the paper "Computation and application of tissue-specific gene set weights".
        Rows represent MSigDB gene sets and columns represent tissue types. The first row contains the column headers and the first column contains the gene set names.
